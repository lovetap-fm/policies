# Data Export Policy

*Last updated March 1, 2023*

Since it is still early days for Lovetap, there is not yet an automated method for exporting your data, however that is the eventual goal. 

For now, if you want an archive of data from your accounts, you may request one at no charge by [emailing Lovetap support](mailto:help@lovetap.fm). You will receive a link to your data archive within 30 days, and this link will be active for 30 days.

*This policy applies to all products created and owned by Lovetap LLC.*
