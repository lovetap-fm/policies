        <h1>Cancellation Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated March 1, 2023</em></p>
<p>We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account, no questions asked.</p>
<p>Account owners can <a href="mailto:help@lovetap.fm">email help@lovetap.fm</a> to cancel their subscription immediately. When in-app cancellation is available, we will update this document.</p>
<p>Our legal responsibility is to account owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, <a href="help@lovetap.fm">contact us</a>. We will gladly reach out to any current account owners at the email addresses we have on file.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-cancel-an-account%3F" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#what-happens-when-you-cancel-an-account%3F" aria-hidden="true">#</a> What happens when you cancel an account?</h2>
<p>You won’t be able to access your account once your cancellation is processed, so make sure you download everything you want to keep beforehand.</p>
<p>We’ll permanently delete the content in your account from our servers within 60 days of cancellation. <strong>Content can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.</strong></p>
<p>We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle, <a href="help@lovetap.fm">contact us</a> for a <a href="/policies/refunds">fair refund</a>. We’ll treat you right.</p>

<p>We may cancel accounts if they have been inactive for an extended period:</p>
<ul>
<li>For frozen accounts: 180 days after being frozen due to billing failures</li>
<li>For free accounts: after 365 days of inactivity</li>
</ul>
<p>We also retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time, as outlined in our <a href="/policies/terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a>. In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in <a href="/policies/abuse">abusive behavior</a>.</p>
<p><em>This policy applies to all products created and owned by Lovetap LLC.</em></p>
