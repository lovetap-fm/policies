        <h1>Data Export Policy</h1>
        <p><em>Last updated March 1, 2023</em></p>
<p>Since it is still early days for Lovetap, there is not yet an automated method for exporting your data, however that is the eventual goal.</p>
<p>For now, if you want an archive of data from your accounts, you may request one at no charge by <a href="mailto:help@lovetap.fm">emailing Lovetap support</a>. You will receive a link to your data archive within 30 days, and this link will be active for 30 days.</p>
<p><em>This policy applies to all products created and owned by Lovetap LLC.</em></p>
